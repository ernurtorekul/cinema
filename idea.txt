AI Video Generation Platform – Documentation
1. Overview

This platform automates AI-generated video creation using multiple specialized agents. It converts a user-provided scenario into structured image and video prompts, based on characters, cinematic rules, and production knowledge, and optionally produces a draft montage.

Target AI model: Gemini Free version (text-to-image/video prompts).
Input types:

Scenario (text)

Characters database (TXT)

Production books/guides (PDF, TXT)

Output types:

Image prompts per scene

Video prompts per scene

Optional compiled draft video/trailer

2. High-Level Pipeline
Step 0: Project Type Selection

User selects type: trailer, commercial, short film, TikTok video, etc.

Defines constraints: scene length, style, pacing.

Step 1: Scenario Input

Input: Scenario text

Function: Defines the story and goal of the video.

Example: “A hero sneaks into the villain’s lair and discovers a glowing artifact.”

Step 2: Scenario Analysis Agent

Inputs: Scenario text

Outputs:

Scene breakdown (scene/subscene level)

Key actions/events

Timing suggestions per scene

Optional enhancement suggestions (AI-proposed)

Functions:

Break down scenario into scenes

Assign rough seconds per scene

Detect missing beats or suggest cinematic improvements

Step 3: Character Analysis Agent

Inputs: Scene breakdown, character TXT database

Outputs:

Character assignments per scene

Suggested traits, expressions, poses

Character consistency map across scenes

Functions:

Match characters to scenario roles

Suggest additional visual cues (emotion, costume, style)

Ensure consistent representation across scenes

Step 4: Source Material Agent

Inputs: PDFs and text files containing animation, production, and cinematography rules

Outputs:

Scene-by-scene, second-by-second instructions

Camera angles, movements, transitions, visual style cues

Functions:

Read and extract production guidance from source files

Translate guidance into actionable steps for AI prompt generation

Map timing of each scene and sub-scene

Step 5: Prompt Generation Agent

Inputs:

Scene breakdown

Characters assignments

Source material guidance

Outputs:

Image prompts (backgrounds, characters, props)

Video prompts (animations, camera movements, transitions)

Functions:

Generate detailed, Gemini-ready prompts

Ensure visual/style consistency across scenes

Optimize prompts for Gemini Free limitations (text length, content, etc.)

when giving prompt it should also mention separately what parameters to use from listed:
Camera:
Red-v raptor, Sony Venice, max film camera, arri Alexa 35, arriflex 16sr, panavision millennium dxl 2
lenses: 
Lensbaby, hawk -v lite, laowa macro, canon k-35, panavision c-series, arri signature prime , cooke s4, petzval, helios, jdc xtal xpress, zeiss ultra prime
Focal length:
8, 14, 35, 50
Apertures:
F/1.4, f/4, f/11 



Step 6: Montage/Compilation Agent (Optional)

Inputs: Generated images/videos, scene breakdown

Outputs: Draft video or trailer

Functions:

Combine generated media according to scene timing

Apply simple transitions, text overlays, or soundtrack cues

Produce preview-ready video for review

Step 7: Output

Image prompts per scene

Video prompts per scene

Optional draft video/trailer

3. Agent Architecture
Agent	Input	Output	Notes
Scenario Analysis	Scenario text	Scene breakdown, timing, suggestions	Could include AI-generated enhancements
Character Analysis	Scene breakdown, character TXT	Character assignment, traits	Ensure consistency across scenes
Source Material	PDFs/TXT books	Scene instructions, camera, timing	Optional AI parsing library (PyPDF2, Tika)
Prompt Generation	Scene + Characters + Source	Image & video prompts	Gemini-optimized prompts
Montage	Generated media + scene info	Draft video	Optional; basic montage logic
Orchestrator	All agents	Complete workflow	Manages order, data flow, iterative refinement
4. Technical Suggestions

Orchestration

Use a lightweight workflow manager (Python + Async or Node.js with worker queues).

Ensure each agent can be run independently for testing/debugging.

File Handling

Characters: read TXT database (name, traits, style)

Source materials: parse PDFs/TXT with PyPDF2 or Apache Tika

Cache extracted info to avoid repeated parsing

Prompt Optimization

Gemini Free version may have token/length limits → split scenes into smaller prompts

Maintain a style guide in a separate JSON/TXT to keep prompts consistent

Iterative Feedback

Allow user to refine scenario or select alternative character suggestions

Optional: implement loop where AI improves prompts based on previous outputs

Scaling

Start with 1–2 scenes, 1–2 characters, simple montage

Gradually scale to multiple scenes and complex trailers

5. MVP Implementation Suggestions

First version:

Scenario Analysis → Character Assignment → Prompt Generation

Generate prompts for 1–2 scenes only

Skip Montage initially

After MVP:

Add Montage Agent

Include Source Material Agent parsing

Support full trailers/commercials

6. Notes

System is modular and extendable

Can support multiple project types in the future

Focus on Gemini Free for initial prompt generation

All outputs should be Gemini-ready for text-to-image/video generation
